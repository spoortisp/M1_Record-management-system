The automation software organizes the data in meaningful ways, all in one place. You can simply pull out whatever section of the records you want.


.SWOT Analysis

    -Strengths:
Fast data providing and availability were identified among the strengths.
However, this requires smooth operation of the system and data loading without any mistakes.
Presenting statements is also one of the strengths, however, it presupposes that workers
at SRMS have the knowledge to present management reports and executive summaries in an
expected way, moreover, teachers also need a certain level of proficiency in using web reporting
interface.

    -Weaknesses:
Data purity is one of the main weak points of SRMS system since data in data warehouse
and reports generated from them are as reliable as data of source systems. Source systems are
utilised by many users who record data according to different principles and regulations and it
imposes a burden on the SRMS Centre to detect and standardize them.
Another difficulty is the complexity of the system.
strong dependence on IT service providers.
Inflexibility of reports is generally arisen from their complexity. Another reason for it the slow pace of
information flow, because information about the modifications done in the source systems
have to be known also by the operators of the data warehouse in order to set ups of SRMS can be
adapted to the source system.

    -Opportunities:
Management information systems still have significant potential in terms of their uses;
the number of their application fields is unlimited. It may contribute to measure the attainment
of strategic objectives, compare of plan-fact data, perform controlling functions and quantify
the teaching and research performance. Achieving this requires precise and coherent set of
indicators and indicators must be clearly defined.
One of the biggest opportunities stems from the presentation of data from different
source systems in one report as running separate queries is not necessary; instead data
warehouse can solve it by a one-time reporting. An example could be the number of students
per teacher which uses data from database of employees and database of students as well.

    -Threats:
High cost is one of the greatest threats to the functioning of SRMS regarding both the
operation and possible improvements and this is closely linked to that weak point that the
training of an in-house employee for this task is very costly and time consuming.
It is considered a threat as well if teachers cannot be motivated for SRMS, the lack of support
may call into question its presence. Indeed, SRMS has been principally implemented with the
purpose of supporting management decision, this system works to that end.
